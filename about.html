        Hi there, I'm Justin.  I'm 32 years old. I'm from Texas but live in St. Louis. I'm a User Experience Architect. I'm a designer. And, I'm a musician.
        I've been doing design related work for about 14 years now.  I started out doing graphic design.  I got my foot in the door by
        working with local musicians / bands by helping them created marketing collateral. From there, I moved on to web banners, and web design.
        Where I started several of my own design 'companies' over ther years.  (SHHHHH! Only one of them was actually legit.)
</p><p>
        My career in design really started taking off in the early 2000's where I was managing a print shop.  I focused on small &amp; medium sized businesses.
        Doing everything from logo creation, promotional items (pamphlets, flyers, banners, t-shirts, pens, and lots of other things).  While doing that, I started
        applying my design skills to web, and other digital applications.
        </p><p>
        In 2012/13, I started getting inspired by UI and UX designers, that were really changing the way we used products.  This is the time I realized I wanted
        to start focusing on how we use products.  While, I do not have a formal education in design, I spent countless hours reading, studying, and practicing
        my craft, until I finally landed my first professional opportunity.  I took a leap of faith, and started working for myself.  I was getting clients,
        and my hardwork was paying off.
      </p><p>
        In 2014 I was hired as a Designer/Product Manager for a shop in Plano, TX.  Where I helped design, develop, maintain, and manage nearly 300 websites.  I also
        acted as Creative Director, and helped architect close to 50 sites from scratch.
  </p><p>
        In late 2014, I accepted a position as a UX Designer with Magellan Health, and moved to St. Louis. I started as a consultant, 8 months later converted to a FTE, and
        a short 6 months after that I was working as the User Experience Lead on Magellan's internal innovation team led by the CTO, and CAO. That get's us to today.
</p><p>
        I've been meaning to put this site up for sometime.  But I have struggled with what exactly I want to share with the world. We are our own worst critics, and sometimes
        it is very hard to write anything about yourself.  However, if I've learned anything, it's that nothing is perfect, finished, or liked by everyone. My only hope
        is that you can learn a bit about who I am. And maybe be interested in working with me. While I'm not currently seeking full-time work, I'm always open
        to opportunities to collaborate on cool projects, that could make a meaningful impact on the world.
      </p><p>
        So, NICE TO MEET YOU!  Make sure to drop me a line, say hello, and follow me on Twitter &amp; Instagram - @jwranton

        Much Respect,
        J
